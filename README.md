# üìà VBA Stock Market Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes stock market data using **VBA scripting in Excel**. It automates the process of calculating important financial indicators like **quarterly change**, **percentage change**, and **total trading volume** for each stock ticker across multiple sheets representing different quarters or categories. The project is part of a VBA scripting challenge designed to demonstrate automation, logic building, and data analysis skills in Excel.

## How It Works

The script loops through each worksheet (A‚ÄìF or Q1‚ÄìQ4), analyzes the stock data row by row, and outputs the results in a clean summary format with conditional formatting and performance metrics.

### Output Columns:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Ticker` | Stock symbol |
| `Quarterly Change` | Difference between closing and opening prices |
| `Percent Change` | Change as a percentage of the opening price |
| `Total Volume` | Sum of stock volume for that ticker |

### Summary Metrics (per sheet):
| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Greatest % Increase | Highest growth by percentage |
| Greatest % Decrease | Largest drop by percentage |
| Greatest Volume | Ticker with the highest trading volume |
